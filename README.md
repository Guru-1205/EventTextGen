Hey everyone!

It's me, Gc,

I'm excited to share a new project I've been working on: an **image editing and event description rephrasing web app** using Flask. ðŸŽ‰ This handy tool lets you upload images, add event names directly on the images, and rephrase event descriptions for better grammar and readability, all in one place!

Here's how it works:

- **Upload Your Images:** Easily upload multiple images.
- **Event Names:** Type in your event names, which will be neatly placed at the top-middle of each image.
- **Description Rephrasing:** Enter event descriptions, and watch as they get magically rephrased using Google Gemini, providing you with polished and grammatically correct content.
- **Download as `.docx`:** Finally, download a `.docx` file that includes all your edited images and rephrased descriptions, ready to be shared or printed.

By default, the tool is set up to process images and descriptions for quick and easy use. But don't worry, it's fully customizable! You can adjust the font, text position, or even the integration settings with a bit of code tweaking.

If you encounter any bugs or need help, feel free to reach out. I'm here to assist and make your experience as smooth as possible. So go ahead, upload some images, add your events, and get those descriptions rephrased!

This introduction aims to be engaging and friendly while providing a clear overview of what your project does and how users can benefit from it.

# Image Editor and Event Description Rephrasing

This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload images, input event names and descriptions, and receive a `.docx` file containing edited images and rephrased event descriptions. The edited images display the event names at the top, and the descriptions are rephrased using the Google Gemini text generation model.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-editor-rephrasing.git
cd image-editor-rephrasing
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `requirements.txt`

Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes:

```
flask
pillow
requests
python-docx
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask Application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your Web Browser:**

   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

3. **Upload Images and Input Event Details:**

   - Upload one or more images.
   - Enter event names and descriptions.
   - Click the "Submit" button to generate and download the `.docx` file.

## Configuration

### Font Path

Update the `FONT_PATH` in `app.py` to point to a valid font file on your system. Example paths:

- Linux: `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf`
- Windows: `C:\Windows\Fonts\Arial.ttf`
- macOS: `/Library/Fonts/Arial.ttf`

### Google Gemini API

To get an API key for using the Gen AI API for text generation, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Gen AI Account

If you haven't already, you'll need to create an account on the Gen AI platform:

- Visit the [Gen AI website](https://gen.ai/).
- Click on "Sign Up" or "Get Started" to create your account.
- Fill in the required information to register.

### 2. Log In to Your Account

Once you have created your account, log in using your credentials:

- Go to the [Gen AI login page](https://gen.ai/login).
- Enter your email address and password to log in.

### 3. Navigate to API Access

After logging in, navigate to the API access section to generate your API key:

- Look for a section or tab labeled "API Access," "Developer," or "API Keys." This is typically found in your account settings or dashboard.
- Click on the section related to API access.

### 4. Generate API Key

Follow the steps to generate your API key:

- If available, click on a button like "Generate API Key" or "Create New API Key."
- Some platforms might require you to provide a name or description for the API key to help identify its usage.

### 5. Copy Your API Key

Once the API key is generated, copy it to your clipboard:

- The API key is usually displayed in a text box or a pop-up window after generation.
- Make sure to copy the entire API key. It is typically a long alphanumeric string.

Ensure you have access to the Google Gemini text generation model or equivalent. Modify the `rephrase_content` function in `app.py` to integrate with the API, including any required authentication or API keys.

```python
def rephrase_content(description):
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')
    response = model.generate_content(description)
    return response.text
```

## Dependencies

- **Flask:** Web framework for the application.
- **Pillow:** Image processing library.
- **Requests:** Library to handle HTTP requests.
- **python-docx:** Library to create and manipulate `.docx` files.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.
